Deployment Guide
I've also created a detailed Cloudflare deployment guide that explains:

How to set up the email processing backend on a traditional server
How to create a Cloudflare Worker as an API gateway
How to deploy the React frontend to Cloudflare Pages
How to configure DNS and security settings
How to set up monitoring and maintenance procedures

User Guide
The user guide explains how to use the application, including:

Creating and configuring tests
How recipients report where emails landed
Analyzing test results and recommendations
Working with test history and exporting data

This solution offers significant advantages over traditional deliverability testing:

It provides actual placement data rather than simulated results
It works with any email service provider
It gathers real user feedback about rendering issues
It helps identify specific factors affecting deliverability
